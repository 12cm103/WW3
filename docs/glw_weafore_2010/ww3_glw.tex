\section{The Great Lakes wave model at NOAA/NCEP}

The WAVEWATCH III model has been implemented operationally by NOAA/NCEP for most
major weather forecast guidance areas in the world under USA jurisdiction since
2000. With the objective to extend this standard NOAA/NCEP wind-wave forecasting
guidance approach to the Great Lakes, the Environmental Modeling Center (EMC) at
NOAA/NCEP launched, in 2004, a formal project envisaging the operational
implementation of WAVEWATCH III in the region within a 2-year time frame. 

The initial plan included using the WAVEWATCH III model with wind fields derived
from the ETA model. Ice concentrations were to be included int he system,
provided by operational analyses made at the NOAA/NCEP. Also planned was the
inclusion of dynamically updated mean water levels on a seasonal time scale.
WAVEWATCH III was to be implemented in a single grid encompassing the five major
lakes that integrate the Great Lakes system -- Erie, Huron, Michigan, Ontario
and Superior.
