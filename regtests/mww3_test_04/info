#  - Note that the outer boundary data is generated by a 1-D model, with    #
#    one version of the script running this as a separate ww3_shel, the     #
#    other option integrating it in ww3_multi as the third model.           #
#  - Choice of governing euqations in WAVEWATCH III implies that it is      #
#    not possible to do a purely monochromatic propagation over currents,   #
#    as changes in wavenumbers are modeled as propaption in k-space.        #
# - Grads scripts generated by this test can be used to visualize results.  #
#   If the MPRF switch is used the grofiing data sets are copied to the     #
#   home directory for display with profile.gs.                             #
# - Script set up for parallel running :                                    #
#    a) For cluster with mpirun activate mpirun command lines and set       #
#       environment with valiables MPI and proc in section 0.               #
#    b) For IBM with poe, activale poe command lines and set environment    #
#       variables in poe jobcards at the top of the scripts.                #
#                                                                           #
