\subsection{~Installing files}\label{sec:install}
\vssub

\noindent
In its packaged public version (tar file distribution), \ws\ is
contained in several files:

\begin{list}{???}{\parsep 0mm \itemsep 0mm 
                  \leftmargin 20mm \rightmargin 5mm
                  \labelwidth 10mm \labelsep 5mm}
\item[{\file install\_wwatch3\_tar} \hfill]
The \ws\ install program. 

\item[{\file wwatch3.[VERTAG].model.tar} \hfill] Archive file containing 
 source codes (ftn directory), programs and scripts controlling the
compiling and linking of and code management of \ws (aux and bin
directories), and sample input files (inp directory).

\item[{\file wwatch3.[VERTAG].regtests.tar} \hfill]
Archive file containing several regression test cases.

\item[{\file wwatch3.[VERTAG].cases.tar} \hfill]
Archive file containing several large tests involving real case scenarios. 

\end{list}

\noindent
The label [VERTAG] is typically a version number for the model package, which
may be followed or preceded by alpha-numeric tags describing other
characteristics of the distribution package (e.g., v4.18.beta for the beta
version 4.18 etc).

As the first step of installing \ws, these files have to be copied to a work
directory on the machine on which \ws\ will be installed. Because this
directory will be the `home' directory of \ws, it is suggested that a new
directory is created (see also warning in previous section). Furthermore
{\file install\_wwatch3\_tar} has to be made executable by typing
\command{chmod 700 install\_wwatch3\_tar} after which the installation of the
files is started by typing \command{install\_wwatch3\_tar} at your Linux/Unix
prompt.

\parbox{120mm}{The install program will ask for a compiler to compile some
auxiliary \fortran\ codes. Unlike the actual \ws\ source code, these programs
are still written in \fortran-77. It is therefore sufficient to point toward
the generic \fortran-77 compiler on the system. The {\file install\_ww3\_tar}
script allows the user to set pre-defined choices that will point the
\fortran-77 to a generic executable {\file f77}. This may not be available on
your system, so make sure that an appropriate choice is made during the
installation process.}

WARNING \rule[1mm]{55mm}{1.0mm}
\end{center}

When {\file install\_wwatch3\_tar} is executed for the first time, it will ask
the user to identify the directory in which \ws\ will be installed. This has
to be confirm that the installation directory is the current directory. The
program will then print a message that it cannot find the setup file, and ask
some questions. The default answer or options are shown in square
brackets. After the user has verified that the setup parameters are
satisfactorily, the install program will, by default, create the (hidden)
setup file {\file .wwatch3.env} in the user's home directory.  An alternate
setup file may be specified prior to running {\file install\_wwatch3\_tar} by
setting {\code WWATCH3\_ENV} in the user environment.  The setup can be
modified by rerunning the install program, or by manually editing the setup
file. The `home' directory of \ws\ can only be changed by editing or removing
{\file .wwatch3.env} or by changing {\code WWATCH3\_ENV} in the user
environment.

After the setup file is processed, the install program asks if the user wants
to continue with the installation. If the user chooses to continue, the
program will look for the archive files. If a file is found, the program asks
if the contents of the file should be installed. If no files are found, the
archive files do not reside in the home directory, or the home directory is
erroneously defined. To avoid that the install program generates unwanted
files and directories in such a case, abort the install program (type Ctrl C),
and check the location of the archive files, and the `home' directory of \ws\
(see previous paragraph).

After files to be unpacked have been identified, the program will ask if old
files should be overwritten automatically. If the user chooses `n', the
program will ask permission to overwrite each file that already exists. Files
that contain user specific information, such as compile and link options, will
never be replaced by the install program.

As the first step of the actual installation, the install program checks if
the following directories exist in the `home' directory of \ws.
 
\begin{dlist}
\dit{arc }{Archive directory.}
\dit{aux }{Raw auxiliary programs (source codes etc.).}
\dit{bin }{Executables and shell scripts for compiling and linking.}
\dit{exe }{\ws\ executables.}
\dit{ftn }{Source code and makefile.}
\dit{inp }{Input files.}
\dit{mod }{Module files.}
\dit{obj }{Object files.}
\dit{test}{Scripts with test cases.}
\dit{work}{Auxiliary work directory.}
\end{dlist}

\noindent
All these directories are generated by the install program {\file
install\_wwatch3}, except for the archive directory, which is generated by
{\file arc\_wwatch3} (see below).

If installation of the auxiliary programs is requested (file {\file
wwatch3.aux.tar}), the install program will first process source codes of
auxiliary programs, using the compiler as defined by the user in the setup
file. Note that these codes are still in fixed format \fortran-77.

\begin{flist}
\fit{w3adc.f }{\ws\ {\fortran} preprocessor.}
\fit{w3prnt.f}{Print files (source codes) including page and line numbers.}
\fit{w3list.f}{Generate a generic source code listing.}

\fit{w3split.f}{Generate spectral bulletin identifying individual wave fields
  within a spectrum from the spectral output of the point output
  post-processor (see \para\ref{sec:ww3outp}). This is a legacy code
  superseded by generating bulletins directly from {\file ww3\_outp}. It is
  retained here for historical reasons only.}

\end{flist}

\noindent
The above source codes are stored in the directory {\dir aux} and the
executables are stored in the directory {\dir bin}. A more detailed
description of these programs (including instructions on running the
executables) can be found in the documentation included in the above source
code files. After the compilation of these programs, several \unix\ shell
scripts and auxiliary files are installed in the {\dir bin} directory.

\begin{flist}
\fit{ad3              }{Script to run the preprocessor {\file w3adc}
                        and the compile script {\file comp} for a given
                        source code file.}
\fit{ad3\_test        }{Test version of {\file ad3}, showing modifications
                        to original source file. This script does not
                        compile code.}
\fit{all\_switches    }{Generates a list of all {\code w3adc} switches 
                        present in the source code files.}

                        script {\file comp} will be copied from this

\fit{install\_ww3\_tar }{Script to install \ws\ from tar files.}
\fit{link.gen         }{Generic linker script. Actual script is {\file

\fit{link.{\it xxx}   }{The link script {\file comp} for a specific

\fit{make\_makefile.sh}{Script to generate the of the makefile based
                        on selections in the file {\file switch})}. 
\fit{switch.gen       }{Generic file with preprocessor switches
                        (\para\ref{sec:switches}).}
\fit{w3\_clean        }{Script to clean up work and scratch directories
                        by removing files generated during compilation or

\fit{w3\_make         }{Script to compile and link components of \ws\

                        to account for changes in compiler switches in

\fit{w3\_setup        }{Script for creating/editing the \ws\ environment setup
                        file. The default setup file is
                        {\file \$\{HOME\}/.wwatch3.env}.  An alternate setup
                        file can be specified with the {\code WWATCH3\_ENV}
                        environment variable.}
\fit{w3\_source       }{Script to generate a true \fortran\ source

                        (see \para\ref{sub:ww3gspl}).}
\end{flist}

\noindent
The use of these scripts is explained in \para\ref{sec:comp}.  Note that the
above scripts acquire setup information from the \ws\ environment setup file
defined by {\code WWATCH3\_ENV}, or, if that is not defined, from the default
setup file {\file .wwatch3.env} in the home directory of the user.

\noindent
After installation in the {\dir bin} directory, several GrADS scripts are
installed in the {\dir aux} directory.

\begin{flist}
\fit{cbarn.gs         }{Semi-standard GrADS script for displaying
                        color bars.}
\fit{colorset.gs      }{Script to define colors used in shading.}
\fit{profile.gs}      {Script to display profiling data generated by {\file
                       ww3\_multi}.} 
\fit{source.gs}       {Script for composite plot of spectra and source
                       terms (2-D polar or Cartesian plots in color or in
                       black and white).}
\fit{1source.gs}      {Script to plot single source term.}
\fit{spec.gs}         {Script to plot spectra.}
\fit{spec\_ids.gen}   {Data file used by spectral / source scripts.}
\end{flist}

\noindent
This directory also has various additional tools in and documentations, see
the actual directory for its contents.  As the final step of processing {\file
wwatch3.aux.tar}, some links between directories are established.

Finally, the install program lists manual modifications required by or
suggested to the user. These messages are printed only if the compile and link
system are installed (file {\file wwatch3.aux.tar}).
