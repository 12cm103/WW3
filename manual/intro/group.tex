\subsection{~The development group}

Even in its original development, when I was working on the code mostly on my
own on the development of \ws, many have contributed to the success of the
model. With the expansion of physical and numerical parameterizations
available, the list of contributors to this model is growing. I would like to
recognize the following contributors as the development group (in alphabetic
order) :

\begin{list}{\ldots}{ }

\item [Henrique Alves] (SRG at NOAA/NCEP/EMC, USA) \\
  Support of code development while at NCEP, shallow water physics packages.

\item [Fabrice Ardhuin] (Ifremer, France, previously at SHOM, France) \\
  Various physics packages, interface with unstructured grid schemes.

\item [Nico Booij] (Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands) \\
  Original design of source code pre-processor ({\code w3adc}), basic method
  of documentation and other programming habits. Spatially varying wavenumber
  grid.

\item [Dmitry V. Chalikov] (\ldots) \\ Co-author of the
  \cite{tol:JPO96} input and dissipation parameterizations and source code.

\item [Tim Campbell] \ldots

\item [Arun Chawla](NOAA/NCEP/EMC, USA) \\
  Support of code development at NCEP, GRIB packing, automated grid generation
  software \citep{tol:MMAB07a, tol:OMOD08a}.

\item [W. Erick Rogers] \ldots

\item [Aron Roland] (T. U. Darmstadt, Germany) \\
  Advection on unstructured (triangle-based) grids and meshing tools.

\item [Hendrik L. Tolman] (NOAA/NCEP/EMC). General code architecture,
  development and management.

\item [Barbara Tracy] (US Army Corps of Engineers, ERDC-CHL, retired, USA) \\
  Spectral partitioning

\item [Gerbrant Ph. van Vledder] (Delft University of Technology, NL) \\
  Webb-Resio-Tracy exact nonlinear interaction routines, as well as some of
  the original service routines.

\item [Andr\'e van der Westhuysen](IMSG at NOAA/NCEP/EMC, USA) \\
  Support of code development at NCEP, wave system tracking.

\item [Stephan Zieger] \ldots
\end{list}
