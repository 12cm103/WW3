\noindent
The SMC grid \citep{art:Li11} is an extension of the Cartesian multiple-cell
grid \citep{art:Li03} onto the spherical coordinate system. It is an unstructured
grid but retains the conventional lat-lon grid cells so that all propagation
formulations on the spherical coordinates are still applicable on
the SMC grid and hence do all the finite difference schemes. The SMC
grid relaxes the CFL restriction at high latitudes in a similar fashion
as the reduced grid \citep{art:RA94}. Polar cells are introduced to remove
the polar singularity of the differential transport equation by switching
to an integral equation. Upstream non-oscillatory 2nd order (UNO2)
advection schemes \citep{art:Li08} is implemented on the SMC grid for both
spatial and inter-spectral propagation. A simple rotation scheme is
used for wave refraction induced rotation and the great circle turning.
The refraction scheme is uncontitionally stable for any time step
but is restricted by its physical limiter to the local gradient direction.
Diffusion term simlar to the \cite{art:BH87} for alleviation
of the garden sprinkler effect is used but the diffusion coefficient
is simplified to a single homogeneous parameter ($D_{nn}$ as in Eq.~(\ref{eq:Dnn_d})).
Reduction of computing time with this new grid is significant in comparison
with the conventional grid, thanks to the relaxed time step restriction
at high latitudes and removal of land points from the model. A remedy
for the invalided scalar assumption at high latitude is provided to
extend the global wave model into the entire Arctic Ocean.

SMC grid can be used for replacing the regular lat-lon grid so that
the model domain can be extended to high latitudes or even the North
Pole without reducing the time step. This application requires little
changes to the regular grid model except for preparing a few extra
input files, including the cell array and face array files. The cell
array can be generated with the existing regular grid bathymetry by
using the sea points only and merging cells in the longitudinal directions
at a few latitude steps. 

Another important use of the SMC grid is for multi-resolution grids.
The base level SMC grid cell can be refined into 4 quarterly cells
by halving both the longitude and latitude grid lengths. Any cell
on this refined level can be further dividied into another 4 quarterly
cells. This refinement can go on as required, resulting in multi-resolution
grids in a few refined levels. For consistency, the single resolution
SMC grid is considered to have only one level. Wind forcing will remain
to be at the base level resolution for all SMC grids (one level or
multi-level) and it will be interpolated on to the refined levels
(if any) inside the WW3 model. The normal regular grid input files,
such as the water depth, land-sea masks, and sub-grid obstruction,
are also required at present.

One important feature of the SMC grid is that it is an unstructured
grid, that is, the cells are not required to be listed side by side
as in their physical position. For the conveniency of multi-resolution
SMC grid, the cells are sorted by their sizes so that cells on one
given level are grouped together in one sub-loop for a shared sub-time-step.
The base level time step is halved as the grid length for the refined
level sub-step. This effectively avoids the model to be slowed down
by the refined cells due to their CFL restrictions. Neighbouring cells
information for propagation schemes are provided with cell face arrays,
which are pre-calculated for the given cell array list. So there is
no need to expand the sea point only SMC grid cells onto a full grid
for propagation. \ref{fig:SMCells}illustrates how SMC cell arrays
are defined and \ref{fig:SMC_Arctic}shows the Arctic region in a
6-12-25 km three level SMC grid. The golden and red circles mark the
global and Arctic parts in the SMC6-25 grid. The Arctic part within
the golden circle requires a fixed reference direction to define its
wave directional bins. The global part (upto the golden circle) can
be run independently without the Arctic part. The 4 rows from the
red to the golden circles are duplicated in the Arctic part as boundary
cells if the Arctic part is activated with the ARC option. Separate
cell and face arrays are used for the Arctic part and they are merged
into the global ones within the wave model for propagation.

Some IDL and F90 programs have been developed for generation of SMC
grid cell and face arrays and visualisation of the grid mesh and wave
fields but they have not been formally included in the WW3 package
yet. An IDL program is provided in model/aux/SMCG\_TKs/ to generate
a global 50km SMC grid using a 50km regular grid bathymetry ASCII
input file. Face array generation is done with two F90 programs, one
for the global part and one for the Arctic part. Due to the special
treatment of the polar cell \citep{art:Li12}, face arrays for the Arctic
polar cell requires a different approach than other cells. The face
array file has to be sorted with a simple linux script 'countcells'
before it is fed into the face array generation program. The face
arrays also need to be sorted with a linux script 'countijsd' to determine
the multi-level sub-loop counts. Users are advised to read the guide/SMC\_Grid\_Guide.pdf
for more information about SMC grid generation. Refer to the regression
test \emph{regtests/ww3\_tp2.10} for an example of a 3-level SMC grid
model for the Lake Erie. Users may contact \url{Jian-Guo.Li@metoffice.gov.uk}
