Below, most {\F public} and {\F private} variables in modules are described
briefly (full documentation can also be found in the source code). The file
name of the module is given at the right margin of the start of each list. The
second column of each list identifies the type of the variable. {\F i}, {\F
  r}, {\F l} and {\F c} represent integer, real, logical and character, {\F a}
identifies an array, and{ \F p} identifies a {\F parameter} declaration. All
variables are public, unless marked with \opt. First, parameter settings in
various modules are discussed. After that, the contents of the main storage
modules is discussed.
