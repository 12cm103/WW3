\noindent
Experimental routines for respresentation of the effect of ice on waves have been implemented as IC1, IC2, and IC3. These effects can be presented in terms of a complex wavenumber 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:waveno}
     {k} = {k_r} + i{k_i},
\end{equation}
with the real part ${k_r}$ representing impact of the sea ice on the physical 
wavelength and
propagation speeds, producing effects analogous to shoaling and refraction by bathymetry,
whereas the imaginary part of the complex wavenumber, ${k_i}$, is an exponential decay 
coefficient ${k_i}({x},{y},{t},\sigma $) (depending on location, time and frequency, 
respectively), producing wave attenuation.  The ${k_i}$ is introduced as
${S_{ice}}/{E}=-2{C_g}{k_i}$, 
where ${S_{ice}}$ is a source term (see also \cite{bk:WAM94}, pg. 170).

The effect of sea ice on ${k_i}$ is used for all three of the new source functions (IC1, IC2, IC3). The effect of sea ice on ${k_r}$ does not apply to IC1, has not been implemented for IC2, and has been implemented for IC3.

With the new ice source functions, IC1, IC2, and IC3, ice concentration is not a required input, but if ice concentration has been read in, the source function will be scaled by ice concentration.

In the case of ice, up to five new parameters are
allowed. These can be
referred to generically as ${C_{ice,1}}$, ${C_{ice,2}}$,...,${C_{ice,5}}$.  
The meaning of the ice parameters will vary
depending on which ${S_{ice}}$ routine is selected. 

In the case where any of the new ice and mud source functions are activated with the switches
 {\code IC1}, {\code IC2},  {\code IC3},  {\code BT8}, or {\code BT9}, {\file ww3\_shel} will anticipate intructions for 8 new fields (5 for ice, then 3 for mud). These are given prior to the ``water levels'' information. The new fields can also be specified as homogeneous field using {\file ww3\_shel.inp}. 

The reader is referred to the regression tests {\file ww3\_tic1.1}, {\file ww3\_tic1.2}, {\file ww3\_tic1.3} and {\file ww3\_tic2.1} for examples of how to use the new ice source functions.

The first implemented method (IC1) is for the user to specify 
${k_i(x,t)}$, which is uniform in frequency
space, ${C_{ice,1}}={k_i}$. The parameters ${C_{ice,2}}$,...,${C_{ice,5}}$ are not used. Descriptions specific to IC2 and IC3 are given in following sections.

\textrm{\textit{\underline{Limitations of the code:}}} The interface for the new mud and ice coefficients have only been implemented for {\file ww3\_shel}. Interface for {\file ww3\_multi} will be available in a future revision. 

\textrm{\textit{\underline{Limitations of the physics:}}} The scattering of waves from sea ice is not considered via IC1, IC2, IC3. This is an important physical process (\cite{art:Wad75}), but since it is conservative, it should be treated separately from the source functions IC1, IC2, IC3, which are intented to represent non-conservative effects of sea ice. This work is in progress.
